## Prerequisite

You should have latest node installed in your computer.

For this I am using Itune's free API to get music collection and songs etc.

The iTunes Search API can be found at:

Once you copy/clone repo locally you are good to go. just do `npm install` inside cloned project, it will take a while depend on your network speed. After that move to `./ios` and run `pod install` and go back to previous folder.

Then run `react-native run-ios` to run in ios and `react-native run-android` to run in android. Your server will be up and running, & it will open application.
